On November 1st, 2024, I sat down with Viktor Lidholt to discuss Flock, Nest, and community questions and concerns.

Viktor is the founder of <a href="https://serverpod.dev/">Serverpod</a>, which is currently the most 
extensive Dart-based server solution on the market. Viktor is also a former member of the Flutter
team, and generally a highly engaged member of the Flutter community.

Viktor asked to sit down with me to discuss various community concerns about Flock, as well as some
of his own concerns.
