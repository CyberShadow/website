The Flock is migrating to [https://getflocked.dev](https://getflocked.dev) and
[https://github.com/join-the-flock](https://github.com/join-the-flock).

A few days ago we received a request from the Flutter team to change our domain name and GitHub
organization to avoid the term "foundation". We were notified that some important Flutter customers
were worried that Google's role in Flutter was changing, because those customers use a very specific
definition for the term "foundation".

We're here to accelerate Flutter, not slow it down, so we complied with the request. If something as
minor as a domain name is damaging customer relationships then we have no problem changing it. So
we did.

Please update all of your URLs to reflect the new destinations. The existing website will redirect
to the new domain to preserve the existing URLs. No additional pages will be published to the old
domain.

## A note to our friends in the community
Over the years, the abstract concept of a "Flutter foundation" has come up many times. Sometimes I
was involved with those conversations, and at other times I wasn't. Across those conversations,
there was never any notion that Google needed to be involved with the foundation. Instead, the
thru-line across those conversations was the involvement of some number of companies, focused on
market interests.

Sometimes the conversation around a "foundation" focused on companies pooling funds. At other times
it focused on companies steering development direction. But the conversation was never focused on
Google abandoning Flutter, or giving up authority over Flutter, or any similar eventuality.

For those in the community who continue these conversations, please be aware that the Flutter team
expects any use of the term "foundation" to involve direct partnership with them. To avoid a similar
headache, be sure that you don't use that term in your community work if that's not what you intend
to do.
